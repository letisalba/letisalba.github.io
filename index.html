                <p class="mb-4"> Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is a reproductive hormonal imbalance condition affecting as 
                  much as 5 million women in the US alone. It's believed that genetics and environmental factors can cause PCOS 
                  that affect their body physically and emotionally along with their metabolism, overall health and appearance 
                  in women. PCOS causes problems in ovaries making it hard for women to have a healthy menstrual cycle leading 
                  to the development of cysts and infertility. Although very common in women of reproductive age, PCOS may begin 
                  shortly after puberty but can also develop during the later teenage years and early adulthood.</p>
                <p class="mb-4"> <b>Hormones that are involved in PCOS are:</b></p>
                <ul>

                <li>Androgens: aka "male hormones" are present in women with PCOS at higher levels than usual. 
                  Excess in androgens can cause symptoms such as acne, unwanted hair, thinning hair, and irregular periods.</li>  
                  
                <li>Insulin: allows the body to absorb glucose (blood sugar) into the cells for energy. In PCOS, 
                  the body doesn't respond to insulin as intended therefore, elevations in blood glucose levels can be assessed. 
                  Such elevations then lead to increased production of androgen.</li>
                  
                <li>Progesterone: vital hormone for menstruation and pregnancy; lack of progesterone contributes 
                  to irregular periods.</li>
                </ul>

                <p class="mb-4"> Many of these symptoms can be attributed to other causes or go unnoticed but it is very common for 
                  PCOS to go undiagnosed for some time. <b>Here are some symptoms that help with the diagnosis:</b>
                  :</p>
                <p class="mb-4">&bull; Irregular periods: irregular or missed periods as are a result of not ovulating is a common 
                  signs of PCOS.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">&bull; Polycystic ovaries: some may develop cysts in their ovaries but some don't. Ovaries may be 
                  enlarged and follicles surrounding their eggs therefore failing to function regularly.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">&bull; Excess androgen: elevated levels of male hormones can cause excess hair and acne.</p>

                <ul>

                <h4 class="text-black">Other symptoms may include:</h4>
                <li>Weight gain: many people with PCOS will have weight gain or obesity that is difficult to manage.</li>
                <li>Fatigue: increase in fatigue or low energy is also common</li>
                <li>Unwanted hair growth: due to excess androgen, areas such as face, arms, back, chest, hand, toes 
                  and abdomen may have excess hair growth.</li>
                <li>Thinning hair on the head: hair loss may increase in middle age for those with PCOS</li>
                <li>Infertility: PCOS is a leading cause for infertility but not everyone's the same.</li>
                <li>Acne: due to hormonal changes, acne can be arise and make skin oilier than usual and 
                  cause breakout in the face, chest and upper back.</li>
                <li>Darkening of skin: areas such as under arms, breasts or back of your neck may get 
                  dark, patchy or thicken</li>
                <li>Mood changes: mood swings, depression and anxiety can increase</li>
                <li>Pelvic pain: pain may occur with periods along with heavy bleeding or without bleeding</li>
                <li>Headaches: can occur due to hormonal changes</li>
                <li>Sleep problems: most people often suffer with problems such as insomnia or poor sleep. 
                  These arise due to many factors but a common one is having sleep apnea (sleep disorder). Even when you fall 
                  asleep you wake up as if you have not slept at all or have trouble falling asleep.</li>
                <li>Depression: can arise due to symptoms that can alter your appearance and have a negative 
                  impact on your emotions.</li>
                <p class="mb-4"> <b>It's good to note that not everyone who is diagnosed with PCOS experiences all of these symptoms 
                  and should always consult with their PCP or OBGYN to get an accurate diagnosis.</b></p>

                    <li>The endometrium is the inner layer. During a woman’s menstrual cycle, hormones cause the endometrium to change. 
                      Estrogen causes the endometrium to thicken so that it could nourish an embryo if pregnancy occurs. In the plot 
                      below you notice the difference in endometrium size for women with PCOS (lower) than with those without PCOS (slightly higher).</li>

                    <li>Sadly, abortions also plays a part in PCOS for women trying to conceive. I am however happy to see that the number isn’t as high for women with PCOS.</li>

                  <p class="mb-4">Being diagnosed almost 2 years ago with PCOS I was intrigued to learn more and explore the data that 
                    was available. Although not much data was easily accessible this is a start to explore differences or similarities 
                    women share with their physical aspect and blood work. It’s also important to be aware of symptoms experienced by 
                    PCOS because it’s such symptoms that can always be misinterpreted as “too much stress” or “lose weight” by doctors. 
                    Essentially we could use these commonalities to help women all over learn to distinguish symptoms not only by the 
                    physical aspects of PCOS but also during a routine lab work. After advocating for myself with multiple doctors over 
                    the span of 6 years I saw the true value in listening to your body and sharing my experience with others. I hope 
                    this project is able to make women aware of what to look out for, what kind of questions to ask, and to be 
                    persistent with their health because who knows our bodies better than ourselves.</p>
